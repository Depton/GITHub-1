To push file from local repository to remote repository 
Create your remote repository in git up
Create a folder (Mkdir)
Create a file {touch or vim}
Initialize git 
add file using git add . or file name 
use git status to verify fil 
use git commit -m with good commit message
For the first push use git remote push origin master
After that you can do git pull and see changes on your machine.
To update your local repo with latest code from remote repo, use git fetch origin master
Then merge it into your current branch by using git checkout master && git merge origin/master.
This will bring all the changes from remote repo to your local repo.
If there are any conflicts then resolve them manually.
Once resolved, commit those changes and push again using git push origin master.
Now both repositories have same files.
You can clone this repository to another machine and repeat above steps to get updated version of project.
